  <h2>Info about ARAM' PIZZA PIZZERIA’s Healthy Measures and Safety Protocols</h2>

  <p>
    At <strong>ARAM' PIZZA PIZZERIA</strong>, we take health very seriously… even if our cheese prefers to bask in the sunlight. 
    Here, with full transparency and dedication, we share all the measures we take to ensure every pizza arrives hot, safe, and delicious.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Hygiene Commitments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Continuous training:</strong> our entire team receives monthly training in food handling, allergen control, and hygiene practices.</li>

  <h3>Little Touches from Our Kitchen</h3>
  <p>
    Our oven performs its own “stretching exercises” between batches to keep the heat perfectly balanced, 
    and the team has its own handwashing playlist — 20 seconds of rhythm with a dash of Naples spirit.  
    The result: pizzas as safe as they are delicious.

  <h3>Honorary Recognition</h3>
  <p>
    We are proud to hold the title of <em>“Golden Seal of Food Safety and Gastronomic Well-Being”</em>, 
    awarded by <strong>Dr. Giacomo Lefèvre</strong> — a French-Italian microbiologist from Marseille, 
    known for his peculiar inspection method: examining dough texture under a laboratory magnifier.  
    After visiting our kitchen, Dr. Lefèvre enthusiastically stated:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Here, even the mozzarella looks like it passed a medical exam.”
