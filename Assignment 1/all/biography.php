Founded in 1973 in a small corner of Lyon, ARAM' PIZZA PIZZERIA was born from an idea as absurd as it was brilliant. Its creator, Aram DelaCroûte, was a young baker frustrated because his baguettes always ended up round and covered in tomato sauce. One day, after an unfortunate encounter involving a bicycle wheel, a block of cheese, and an overly enthusiastic oven, Aram accidentally invented the first “French pizza with Italian spirit and a sense of humor.”
Over time, Aram decided to take his culinary accident seriously. He traveled to Italy to learn “the art of pizza” and came back convinced he could unite the best of both worlds: French technique and Italian passion. Thus, ARAM' PIZZA PIZZERIA was born — a small restaurant filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread, homemade sauces, and lively debates about which wine pairs best with a classic Margherita.
For decades, the restaurant became a gathering place for locals, artists, and curious travelers. Its laid-back atmosphere and playfully named pizzas (“La Tragedie du Fromage,” “La Baguetta Calzone”) made it a local legend.
In 2024, the new generation of the DelaCroûte family decided to refresh the space without losing its soul. Now, with a modern and minimalist design, Aram’s spirit lives on — warm, a little chaotic, but always delicious.
The motto painted on the main wall says it all:

“Baked with heart (and sometimes a little luck).”
